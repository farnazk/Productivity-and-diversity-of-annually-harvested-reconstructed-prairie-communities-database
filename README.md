Three main files were used for the analyses conducted in “Productivity and diversity of annually harvested reconstructed prairie communities”. Each of these files are associated with a data dictionary in which we define the meaning of variables and values.

1- prod_pre_div.csv was used to evaluate the relationship between productivity and precipitation. We also used this file for the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of productivity, species richness, Simpson’s evenness and Simpson’s diversity. This file was used to create Figures 1 and 2. The data dictionary for this file is Dictionary_prod_pre_div.csv file. 

2-	species_cover.csv was used for the ANOVA on the cover of individual plant species, cover of functional groups, and forb flowering phenology through the season. This file was used to create Figures 3 and 4 and Table 2. The data dictionary for this file is Dictionary_species_cover.csv. 

3-	species_proportional_cover.csv was used for multivariate analyses- i.e. non-metric multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), Multi Response-Permutation Procedure (MRPP), and the matching of ordination method. This file was used to create Figure 5. The data dictionary for this file is Dictionary_species_proportional_cover.csv.
